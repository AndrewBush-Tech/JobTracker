# üíº Job Application Tracker

A full-stack application to help you efficiently track your job applications.

Built with:

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot + PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** React (Vite or Create React App)  
- **Database:** SQLite (for importing scraped jobs), PostgreSQL (for persistent job tracking)

---

## üöÄ Features

- Create, update, and delete job applications  
- Import job listings from a local SQLite database (`jobs.db`) generated by [JobFinder](https://andrewbush-tech.github.io/jobFinder/)  
- Auto-fill job details when importing from local job data  
- REST API with CORS enabled for smooth frontend-backend integration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.  
   > Alternatively, for local testing, you can configure an in-memory H2 database by updating `application.properties`.

2. Open a terminal, navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd jobtracker
```

3. Run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend (React)
1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend folder:

   ``` bash
   cd jobtracker-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # If using Vite
   # or
npm start         # If using Create React App
```
3. The frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000

## Import Jobs from SQLite

To import jobs from a local SQLite database (jobs.db) generated by your job scraper:

Place jobs.db in the backend folder (/jobtracker).

Ensure the backend server is running.

Use a tool like curl or Postman to trigger the import:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/applications/import
```

This will import the job listings from the SQLite file into your PostgreSQL job tracking database.
